### What is Equibit?

Equibit is a proof-of-work (POW) peer-to-peer (P2P) protocol forked from Bitcoin. Peer-to-peer networks are the safest way to safeguard securities in a digital economy. As the world economy reshapes itself in a post-dollar era, the need to safeguard digital promises is greater than ever. Political turmoil always includes economic treachery. Equibit can protect our securities through political and economic instability.

Equibit is a form of digital paper usable to issue stock certificates and digital assets ownership securities. Equibit is better than other forms of electronic stocks because its foundation is built on a simple, open-source, auditable, and dedicated POW blockchain protocol.

### Why blockchain?

Blockchains provide better historical record, better defenses against hacking, censorship resiliency, real-time fraud detection, and defenses against numerous other forms of electronic attacks. Blockchains provide built-in mathematical assurances of authenticity.  

Management of current forms of electronic stock requires trust in a 3rd party that must maintain and defend the databases where securities are registered. In the last few years, we’ve seen governments and the largest corporations on earth, get hacked and loose information that was believed to be secure. It wasn’t.

This repository is a collaboration space for community member interested in participating in the development of the protocol. The network is open to new Testnet nodes! Interested operators should join our #Testnet channel on Discord: https://discord.gg/T2fSExs.
